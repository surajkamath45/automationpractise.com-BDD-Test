Execution Instructions:

Once importing the project from github to a suitable IDE, the behavior driven test can be run using the following two methods:

1. Running as TestNG Test

	i. Right click the project --> Run as --> TestNGTest. 
	ii. An Alternate method to do that would be: right click the testng.xml file (available in the root of the directory) --> Run As --> TestNG Suite 

2. Running as Maven Test

	i. Right click the project --> Run as --> Maven Test (I've added the Maven surefire plugin to the pom.xml to aid this purpose)
